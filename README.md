# Reconsume

Survivors of the Void brings consumable items; but unfortunately, they feel underwhelming.\
Reconsume __restores these items at the beginning of each stage__ and __allows them to be scrappable__.

## Features

- Restore consumed `power elixir` and `delicate watch` at the beginning of each stage
- Allow consumed `power elixir` and `delicate watch` to be scrappable
- Adjust heal strength of the power elixir to 25% max health for balancing
- Highly configurable
	- Change whether an item can be scrappable or refilled at the beginning of each stage
	- Change the heal strength of the `power elixir` for balancing
